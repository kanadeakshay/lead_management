### Introduction

Lead Management is a software solution for **Problem Statement 1** of **CorpsComp** competition organised by IIT BOMBAY in September 2020.
You can read the whole problem statement here ðŸ‘‰ [CorpsComp-PS](/docs/problem_statement)

### Features

- **Authentication** : We have added authentication so that the user/employee first need to register on our side using his/her employee/user id and setup a password and then he can login in the website.

- **Dashboard** : We have a dashboard on which you can see all the activities that happened on the website. i.e., all the leads assigned to and submitted by other users.

- **Profile Page** : Each user has their profile page, where he can see his info and leads assigned to him and previous leads submitted by him.

- **New Lead Form** : Each user can add a new lead in the system and assign it to other users. The default(initial) status of every lead is OPEN.

- **Edit(Validate) Lead Form** : The user can change the status of the lead after it is assigned to him. He can either validate the lead or reject and then the lead will be closed.

- **Filter Leads** : We have a filter on both leads assigned and leads submitted page through which users can filter all the leads based on their status.

- **Downloadable Data** : The user can download all this data by simply clicking on a button. And all the data will be downloaded as a CSV file.
